# TTA-Live-Project:
### The game I developed using Unity on Azure Devops in 2 weeks:
# Castle Diver 2D Platformer:
## Overall Level design:
I used free assets from the Unity Asset Store for my Player, Enemies, Music and Game Enviroment.

## State Machines:
I made fully functional state machines for both my player and enemies. I also made the animations with the sprite images.
### Player:

## Movement:
Player and enemy states determined the actions that could be taken. Like the wall jump I coded into the Player movement.

## Stats:
I made it so that I could easily change different parameters to my player and enemies from Unity.

## Enemy AI:
I added the Cooldown method so that the enemy could not spam the attacks made.
